              These companies run with one main component and that includes transportation. 
              As a result the members associated with them use their own vehicle.
              In some cases their members get incentive based compensation but their vehicle servicing and maintenance cost is regularly increasing. 
              Hence a person associated with these types of companies needs to spend a huge amount of their salary for their vehicle servicing and maintenance on a regular basis.
